## That sounds like a silly idea for an Add-on ...
I agree! This project is just a proof-of-concept. I wanted to try building a
Firefox Add-on with ClojureScript and this was the first marginally useful idea
that I came up with.

## Dependencies
- [Boot - 2.5.1](http://boot-clj.com/)

## Running the Add-on Locally
- `npm run add-on`

## Packaging the Add-on
- `npm run package`

## TODO
- port index.js to cljs
- use :advanced compilation mode
- re-introduce toggle button and allow users to toggle add-on on/off
- tests
- boot publish task
